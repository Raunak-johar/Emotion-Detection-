# Emotion-Recognition
This detects real time emotions from facial expressions of a person.
The project has been implemented using OpenCV and Deep Learning. CascadeClassifier is used for detecting face.
The Convolutional Neural Network used has a self created architecture that has been trained using Keras with TensorFlow as a backend.
The emotions are classified into 6 different categories.
